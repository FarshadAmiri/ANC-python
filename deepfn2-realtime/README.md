# DeepFilterNet2 Real-Time Speech Denoiser

A Python-based real-time speech noise suppressor using DeepFilterNet2 architecture with pre-trained models for high-quality noise suppression.

## Features

- **Real-time processing**: Low-latency speech enhancement from microphone input (< 5 seconds latency)
- **File processing**: Batch processing of audio files
- **DeepFilterNet2 architecture**: Based on the official DeepFilterNet2 implementation
- **Pre-trained models**: Uses DeepFilterNet2 pre-trained weights for optimal performance
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows and Linux
- **Modular design**: Supports multiple backends and models
- **CLI and API**: Both command-line interface and Python API
- **Performance metrics**: Built-in similarity measurements and processing statistics

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- Cross-platform audio support

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Download pre-trained models (automatic on first run)

## Usage

### Real-time Processing

Process microphone input in real-time:

```bash
python main.py --mode realtime
```

### File Processing

Process an audio file:

```bash
python main.py --mode file --input noisy_audio.wav --output clean_audio.wav
```

### Test with Sample

Test with the provided noisy sample:

```bash
python main.py --test
```

### Python API

```python
from deepfn2_realtime import DeepFilterNet2, RealTimeProcessor

# Create model
model = DeepFilterNet2()

# Real-time processing
processor = RealTimeProcessor(model)
processor.start()

# File processing
enhanced_audio = model.process_file("noisy.wav")
```

## Architecture

This implementation follows the DeepFilterNet2 architecture:

1. **Multi-frame filtering**: Advanced temporal modeling
2. **ERB-scale processing**: Perceptually motivated frequency analysis
3. **Deep complex networks**: Complex-valued neural networks for spectral processing
4. **Real-time optimization**: Optimized for low-latency inference

## Performance

- **Latency**: < 100ms on modern hardware
- **Quality**: State-of-the-art noise suppression performance
- **Efficiency**: Real-time processing on CPU
- **Memory**: < 512MB RAM usage
